we want to patch the lines:
.text:08048594                 cmp     al, [ebp+var_9]
.text:08048597                 setz    al

We can change them so that al is always set to 1, regardless of the message:
mov al, 1          
nop                
nop                
nop                
where nop is added to fill the gap that is created.

in our code, we look for the bytes: 3A 45 0F 94 0C which correspond to the line 2 lines above.
when we find it, we change it to B0 01 (which corresponds to mov al, 1) and 90 (which corresponds to nop).
