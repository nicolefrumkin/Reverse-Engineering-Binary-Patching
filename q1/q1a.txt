the message is divided into 3 parts:
1. first byte - num of bytes to xor
2. second byte - starting value to xor with
3. the message itself in bytes

in my validate function, I save the number of bytes to xor in the variable count
then I save the starting value in total
I iterate over the bytes of string (as long as the index is smaller than length of the string)
and xor the bytes.

the result is true if the xored bytes are equal to 0x78.
