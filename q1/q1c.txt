This time we will not change the bit in index 0,
but we will append a bit in the end and increase the counter by one.
The bit we add in the end will be the result of the total xor and 120.
If the count is smaller than the length of the input, then it overrides a byte in the message.
If not, it appends a byte in the end of the message.
